{"business_use_case":"We need to implement a feature called 'Smart Portfolio Manager' that utilizes AI algorithms to provide users with personalized investment recommendations based on their financial goals, risk tolerance, and market trends. This feature should include a user-friendly interface that allows users to input their target savings goals, preferred investment types, and acceptable risk levels. The system should analyze the user's portfolio, suggest adjustments using data from real-time market analysis, and provide alerts on potentially profitable trades or necessary restructuring of their investments. Additionally, it should include a performance tracking dashboard, showing potential growth versus actual performance, so users can make informed decisions. Critical conditions to consider include ensuring data privacy and compliance with financial regulations while implementing machine learning models for accurate predictions."}
