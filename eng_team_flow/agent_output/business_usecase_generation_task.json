{"business_use_case":"Implement a feature that allows users to set automated stop-loss and take-profit triggers on their trades directly within the app. Users should be able to input a specific price point or percentage for their stop-loss and take-profit, with the option for these to be dynamic based on market conditions, such as trailing stop-losses that adjust with rising stock prices. Notifications should be sent to users when these triggers are activated. This feature aims to provide users with more control over their trading risk management while ensuring a seamless experience integrated into the existing user interface. This functionality should consider real-time data integration, security, and reliability to ensure accurate trigger execution."}
