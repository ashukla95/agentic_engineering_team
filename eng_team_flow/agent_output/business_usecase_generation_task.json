{"business_use_case":"We propose to add a feature called 'Smart Portfolio Rebalancing' that allows users to automate the adjustment of their investment portfolios based on pre-defined risk tolerance and market conditions. This feature should enable users to set parameters such as target asset allocation percentages, risk levels, and rebalance frequency (e.g., monthly, quarterly). Important facts include integrating real-time market data to notify users about significant deviations from their target allocations and offering automated recommendations for reinvestment or asset selling. Users should also have the option to review adjustments before finalizing trades, ensuring a transparent process. This feature aims to enhance user engagement by making investment management more accessible and aligned with their financial goals."}
