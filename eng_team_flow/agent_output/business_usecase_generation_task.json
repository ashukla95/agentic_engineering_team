{"business_use_case":"Implement a smart watchlist feature that not only allows users to track their chosen stocks but also provides real-time updates and analytics integrated with AI. This smart watchlist should offer predictive insights on stock trends and notify users of significant changes in stock performance or breaking market news related to the companies in their watchlist. The feature should include customizable alerts for price, volume, and market cap changes, and allow users to categorize and annotate their watchlist for better organization. The user interface must be sleek, intuitive, and responsive to provide an enhanced user experience, differentiating us from competitors like Robinhood."}
