{"business_use_case":"Implement a feature for personalized trading insights that leverage AI and machine learning to analyze individual user behavior and market trends. This feature would provide tailored recommendations for stocks, ETFs, or crypto assets based on the user's trading history, investment goals, and risk tolerance. The user interface should be sleek, presenting insights visually through charts and infographics, along with actionable suggestions for buy/sell/hold. Integration with real-time market data is essential, and the system must allow users to set preferences for the types of insights they want to receive. Compliance with financial regulations and data privacy issues must also be prioritized."}
