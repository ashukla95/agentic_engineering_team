{"scenario":"The feature to be added is a 'Smart Portfolio Rebalancing Tool' that automatically adjusts users' investment portfolios based on real-time market conditions and individual risk preferences. This tool will analyze the performance of assets within the user's portfolio and suggest buying or selling actions to maintain optimal asset allocation according to pre-set risk tolerance levels. Users will have the option to set their rebalancing frequency—daily, weekly, or monthly—and customize their investment goals, such as growth or income generation. Important conditions include triggering alerts for the user when significant market shifts occur and providing educational insights to help users understand the rationale behind the rebalancing decisions. This feature aims to enhance user engagement, boost investment performance, and differentiate our platform from competitors like Robinhood."}
