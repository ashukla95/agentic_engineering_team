{"scenario":"We propose to add a feature called 'Social Trading', which allows users to follow and copy the trading strategies of top traders on our platform. The feature will include a leaderboard showcasing the most successful traders based on metrics such as return on investment, risk levels, and active trading days. Users will have the option to allocate a percentage of their portfolio to mirror the trades of selected traders in real-time. Additionally, to ensure transparency and trust, traders on the platform will be required to provide a verified trading history, along with a brief profile detailing their trading philosophy and approach. The Social Trading feature is meant to attract novice investors who benefit from the expertise of seasoned traders, promoting community and engagement within the platform."}
