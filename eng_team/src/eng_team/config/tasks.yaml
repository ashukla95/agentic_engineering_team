technical_breakdown_task:
  description:  >
    Breakdown the details provided by the business_personal
    into technical tasks that can be understood by the
    software_engineer agent. A simple example to understand 
    would be, let's say you are a data-backed education company,
    the business_personal comes and says, I want a student report
    to be generated using data from Canvas. The report should include
    student, course, enrollment, assignment and login details.\
    A simple breakdown here would be:
    1) Develop and ingestion mechanism to get details from Canvas.
    2) Ingest data into Canvas
    3) Develop the sql query to combine all of the needed details.
    4) Generate the report.
    Now, if you carefully observe, the above mentioned steps are still 
    quite high level but all I want is to give you an essence of what it
    would look like. You task is to generate such technical tasks which
    are concise, idempotent and easily developable and testable.
  expected_output:  >
    A set of technical tasks to be worked on by the engineering team.
    The tas should have title and description of exact feature development.
